Second try at ToDoApp

Title: A To Do App using Javascript, HTML and CSS.

Project Description:

This project is a To Do List App that lets users input specific items to a To Do List, as well as add it to a lis. Additional functionalities include: • deleting items from a list • adding a date and time to a specific item on the list • sorting items alphabetically

Code used and why:

The three Coding languages used are HTML, CSS and Javascript. HTMl has been used to format the basic structure of the webpage and acocmapnying content that will be displayed on the Online Store. CSS was used for styling purposes; mainly with regard to colour choices, layout, sizing and fonts and backgrounds used for the app. Lastly, Javascript has been used mainly for interactivity purposes so that users inputs can dynamically input complex actions that HTML and CSS can't.

Challenges faced:

A few challenges were faced during the creation of the project. The main issue related to the project continuously crashing during the Javascript phase; it felt like every new functionality added would immediately render any interactivity with the App useless. The main way I fixed this issue was by playing around with different ways to do different functions until interactivity was restored. Additionally, several issues came up with general layout, but this was solved with adjusting CSS classes.

How to use Project:

The project is quite easy to use, it follows a general layout of a common website, and simiply playign around and clicking on specific buttons/links will display mor eof the website.
